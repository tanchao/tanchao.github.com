Recently I have been devoted into stock markets, due to I earnt 30% and lost to 10%ï, the interesting part is there is lots of ways to make decisions, no matter i anlysized it, or heard about it, or even lucky draw randomly picked one, there was not a totally my decision, because i didn't have a clear logical for all the trading events. I earnt as I was lucky I lost as I was unlucky, god's fair, faith's fair.

Now chaos.trade is totally my idea, from the idea 'less is more', key point is select the right stock, buy it after 2pm, sell half once it raise 3%, sell another half once it raise 5%, sell all once it backward 2%; of cause if it fails 2% at the beginning, same role. this is super frequent trading stratege, but will see how it works next week, and how it works in decending market.

Now I get the idea why people not anxious about their long-term stocks, because they know current wave won't affect their final revenue. Me too, no matter this startege works or not, I will gain experience, and I will enhance it as I want. It is just a start now, we have a life jouney to go, to financial freedom.

Stay foolish, stay hungry.
