This is a bad habit but a habit of me, when i want to start something new, i would like to init a new environment. In fact it is due to I cannot inist any projects/environments for long, if i always keep working on it i won't able to drop it easily.

Today's work items will be:
* VMPlayer 5 install - done
* Ubuntu 13 install - done
* Java install -
* Tomcat install - 
* IntelliJ IDEA install - 
* Ant install -
* Algo first class code copy & paste with project -
* Install Python 2.7

Well I really want to do some study now as I have been empty for a long long long time again, and I am really boring again.
