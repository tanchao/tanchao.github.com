Things happened recently and I don't even have a time to update my page.
I have moved to NY office since Sep. and used lots of time to settle down.

I brought Mac Book Pro with 8GB Mem 256G SSD today.
I hope join mac community can help my self development work.

Here is the first plan, I have been think about it for a long time.
Naming it chaos.trade.
Mainly a website copy http://zhizuzhefu.com/.

1. WebPy for website
2. Postgres for database
3. Python for data
4. JS for page
