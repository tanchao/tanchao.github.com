h3. notes

* If there is a problem, face it and try to find a way to resolve it, not cross over it
* Be clear about the difference of Income and Assets, Assets can bring you income without your time or work
* Spend your income on yourself first, instead of expense or debt
* Your career is different from your business, think as a boss
* Luxury should only be brought via asset income
* Don't be afraid of failure and mistakes, but make sure you learn from it and would never ever occur it again
