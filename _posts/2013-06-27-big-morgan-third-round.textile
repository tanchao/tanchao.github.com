p. 27th June 2013 - Guangzhou, China

I cannot prepare anything accordingly, I have been reading and learning recently, not only in IT related, but also other staffs.

I failed so many times last year around April, May & June, and all are failed at the final F2F interviews, this time is still telephone interview and have to face interviewer from NYC, LDN, SHH in 3 hours. what I can say? I will represent who am I and what I can do, also I would like to know how I can do.

To be updated on weekend...

bless? pray? just do it.
